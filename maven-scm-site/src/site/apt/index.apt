Maven SCM

  Maven SCM supports Maven 2.x plugins (e.g.
  {{{http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/}maven-release-plugin}})
  and other tools (e.g. {{{http://maven.apache.org/continuum/index.html}Continuum}})
  by providing them with a common API for doing SCM operations. You can look at
  {{{scms-overview.html}the list of SCM's}} for more information on using
  Maven SCM with your favorite SCM tool.
