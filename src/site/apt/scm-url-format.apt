SCM URL Format

* SCM Url

  The general format for a SCM Url is

-------
scm:<scm_provider><delimiter><provider_specific_part>
-------

  As delimiter you can use either colon ':' or, if you use a colon for one
  of the variables (e.g. a windows path), you can use a pipe '|'.

  For information about the provider specific part, see the appropriate
  {{{scms-overview.html}SCM implementation}}.
