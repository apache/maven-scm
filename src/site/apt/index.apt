Maven SCM

  Maven SCM supports Maven plugins (for example
  {{{https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/}maven-release-plugin}})
  and other tools by providing them with {{{./maven-scm-api/apidocs}a common API}} for
  source code management operations. You can look at
  {{{./scms-overview.html}the list of SCMs}} for more information on using
  Maven SCM with your favorite SCM tool.

  In addition, Maven SCM provides two tools to directly use it:

  * {{{./maven-scm-plugin}<<<maven-scm-plugin>>>}}: a Maven plugin, where each SCM command is implemented as a plugin goal,

  * {{{./maven-scm-client}<<<maven-scm-client>>>}}: a simple SCM command line tool.
