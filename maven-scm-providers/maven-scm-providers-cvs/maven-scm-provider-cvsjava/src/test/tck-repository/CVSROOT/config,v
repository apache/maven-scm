# Set `RereadLogAfterVerify' to `always' (the default) to allow the verifymsg
# script to change the log message.  Set it to `stat' to force CVS to verify# that the file has changed before reading it (this can take up to an extra
# second per directory being committed, so it is not recommended for large
# repositories.  Set it to `never' (the previous CVS behavior) to prevent
# verifymsg scripts from changing the log message.
