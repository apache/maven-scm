     * This allows you to answer the question: For this workItem, what changed?
     * Auditors have been known to love this... :)
     * SCMs known to implement this are:
     * <ul>
     * <li>IBM Rational Team Concert (workItem)
     * <li>Microsoft Team Foundation Server (workItem)
     * <li>IBM Rational ClearQuest Enabled UCM ClearCase (task)

     * <P>
     * It should be noted however, when pushChanges = true, a workItem does not
     * need to be set, as the need for a workItem may be optional.
